# MindLang Documentation

The documentation here will guide users on how to develop and implement the unofficial high-level Mindustry Coding Language (MindLang).

## Overview
MindLang is a high-level language designed to simplify coding for **Mindustry**, a game where automation and logic are critical. The official coding language for Mindustry is **MLog**, and MindLang serves as an abstraction layer, making it easier to write and understand complex logic that is later compiled into MLog.
